Project Name: Green Vally Management
Overview:
Green Vally Management is a full-stack web application built to streamline and digitize the operations of a medical facility or hospital. It enables seamless management of patients, doctors, appointments, and admin workflows through a secure, user-friendly interface.
The system supports:
•	Role-based access (Admin & User)
•	Dynamic appointment scheduling
•	Patient and doctor records management
•	Secure login and authentication
•	Real-time availability checks for doctors
•	Responsive UI with pagination and error handling
The primary goal is to simplify administrative tasks, reduce manual errors, and provide a smooth experience for both healthcare staff and patients.
Step 2: Key Features
Green Vally Management offers a comprehensive set of features to manage the day-to-day operations of a healthcare facility efficiently. Below is a breakdown of its core functionalities:
________________________________________ 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

•	Users can only view and book appointments
________________________________________ 2. Patient Management
•	Add, edit, delete patient records
•	View list of all patients with pagination
•	Capitalized name formatting for consistency
•	Basic validations for age and gender inputs
________________________________________ 3. Doctor Management
•	Admins can manage doctor profiles by specialty
•	List doctors by specialty for appointment filtering
•	Dynamically load doctor list based on selected specialty
________________________________________ 4. Appointment Scheduling
•	Real-time available slot generation (30-minute intervals)
•	Prevents double-booking using backend checks
•	Admins can view all appointments with total count
________________________________________
5. Authentication System
•	Secure login page with context-based auth
•	Authentication stored in context and persisted during session
•	Separate access views for admin and regular users
________________________________________ 6. Pagination and Filtering -Lazy Loading
•	Appointments and patients are paginated for performance
•	Dynamic filtering by specialty and doctor for booking
________________________________________
7. Responsive UI (React + Bootstrap + Material UI)
•	Clean interface built using React
•	Uses Bootstrap for layout and Material UI for form controls
•	Mobile-responsive and user-friendly design
________________________________________
8. Testing Coverage
•	Frontend tested with Jest and React Testing Library
Step 3: Technology Stack 
The Green Vally Management system is developed using a modern and scalable technology stack, optimized for performance, maintainability, and modular design.
________________________________________ Frontend

Technology	Purpose
React.js	Component-based UI rendering
Material UI	UI component library for sleek design
Bootstrap	Grid layout and responsive styling
Axios	HTTP requests to communicate with backend
Jest + React Testing Library	Frontend unit and integration testing
________________________________________

 Backend

Technology	Purpose
Node.js	Server runtime environment
Express.js	RESTful API creation and routing
MongoDB	NoSQL database for storing doctors, patients, etc.
Mongoose	ODM for MongoDB (schema modeling & validation)
________________________________________

 Authentication & Authorization

Tool	Description
Context API	Manages user session and roles across app
Role-based routing	Controls access to admin-only functionality
________________________________________ Testing
Library	Purpose
Jest	Unit testing framework
React Testing Library	DOM testing for components
________________________________________



 Tooling & Version Control
Tool	Purpose
Visual Studio Code	Primary development environment
Git & GitHub	Version control and collaboration
Postman	API testing and documentation
Nodemon	Auto-restart server on file changes
________________________________________
Step 4: System Architecture
Green Vally Management follows a modular client-server architecture using the MERN stack, where frontend and backend operate independently but communicate seamlessly via RESTful API.

 2. Components Breakdown
 Frontend (React + Material UI)
•	User interacts with the web interface
•	Role-based rendering of routes and features
•	API calls made using Axios
•	Authentication state stored using React Context
Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
•	Handles all API routes: Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Auth
•	Secures routes using role-based access logic
•	Processes request validation and error handling
•	Communicates with MongoDB using Mongoose
Database (MongoDB)
•	Stores collections for:
o	Patients
o	Doctors
o	Appointments
o	(Optional) Admins/Users
•	Uses ObjectIDs to link appointments to doctors/patients
________________________________________
 Authentication Flow
1.	User submits login credentials
2.	Backend validates against stored users (mock or DB)
3.	On success, user role and data is stored in React Context
4.	UI renders access based on role (admin/user)
________________________________________
 Data Flow Example: Book Appointment
1.	User selects specialty → fetches doctor list
2.	User selects doctor + date → fetches available slots
3.	Form submitted → sends appointment to backend
4.	Backend validates and stores in DB
5.	Appointment list updated on UI via API response
________________________________________
This architecture ensures:
•	Loose coupling (frontend/backend are independent)
•	 Fast rendering with React
•	 Secure role-based access
•	 Easy scalability (can add more modules like payments, prescriptions, etc.)
________________________________________Step 5: Module-wise Explanation
Green Vally Management is composed of independently functioning but interconnected modules. Each module is responsible for handling a core area of the application, enhancing maintainability and scalability.
________________________________________1. Authentication Module
•	Purpose: Validates user credentials and controls access based on user roles (admin or user).
•	Features:
o	Login with username/password
o	Context-based auth state
o	Role-based protected routes
•	Technology: React Context API, Node.js (mocked or future DB support)
________________________________________ 2. Patient Management Module
•	Purpose: Allows admin to maintain detailed records of patients.
•	Features:
o	Add, edit, and delete patient records
o	Capitalize names consistently before saving
o	List patients with pagination
•	Technology: React (form), Axios, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose schema)
________________________________________ 3. Doctor Management Module
•	Purpose: Enables management of doctor information based on specialties.
•	Features:
o	Add and edit doctor details (name, specialty)
o	Filter doctors by specialty for appointment booking
o	Return doctor list dynamically
•	Technology: React dynamic dropdown, Axios, Express, MongoDB
________________________________________4. Appointment Scheduling Module
•	Purpose: Manages booking, updating, and canceling of appointments.
•	Features:
o	Add appointments with patient, doctor, date, and time
o	Prevents double booking using real-time slot availability
o	Allows editing/updating of existing appointments
o	Admin can view all bookings with total count
•	Technology: React forms, dynamic time slots, backend validations, MongoDB
________________________________________5. Slot Availability Module
•	Purpose: Ensures that no time slot is double-booked for a doctor.
•	Features:
o	Dynamically shows available time slots per doctor/date
o	Disabled already-booked slots in UI
o	Supports 30-minute interval slot logic

________________________________________7. Pagination Module
•	Purpose: Improves performance by showing limited data per page.
•	Features:
o	Applied to Appointments and Patients
o	“Previous / Next” and page number buttons
o	Controlled with backend query parameters
•	Technology: Express query params, frontend buttons with current page state
________________________________________ 8. Testing Module
•	Purpose: Ensures reliability and catches errors during development.
